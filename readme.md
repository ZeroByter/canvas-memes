# Canvas Memes

I spend a lot of time in public transportation, bored and usually with nothing better to do.

So with all that boredom and free time, I found myself typing on my computer and creating what I call "random canvas memes".

Basically just a bunch of prototypes, tests, and random mini-games or expirements using a basic JavaScript canvas to render.

### A word of caution

Please be ware that some of these are not complete, buggy, or completely abandoned weird prototypes, so don't judge if you try to run something that just won't work.

Seriously, I have included in this repo a bunch of scripts which aren't even linked in index.js because they don't work.

### Helper files

gamepad.js, grid-map.js, math.js, vector2.js (shamelessly stolen from Unity) are all "helper files" used across the entire project.
