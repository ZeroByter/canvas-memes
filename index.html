                <p>
                    I created this library of canvas memes after I had wasted a lot of time bored in public
                    transportation with nothing to do except creating canvas memes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A canvas meme is basically just a canvas with a bunch of weird shit drawn on it, maybe it will be interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you ask, no, it's not mobile friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="warning">Warning</span>: Some of these memes might not have clear explanations, if any at all. Some of them may be broken! That's ok, they are just small hobby projects- memes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have fun!
